    <p>Paraná is a state in southern Brazil, renowned for its rich agricultural industry and significant hydroelectric energy production. The state is home to iconic tourist destinations such as the Iguaçu Falls, one of the largest and most breathtaking waterfall systems in the world and recognized as one of the New Seven Wonders of Nature. Curitiba, the state capital and largest city, is celebrated for its innovative urban planning, sustainability initiatives, and exceptional quality of life. One of Paraná's most recognized symbols is the Araucária tree, which produces the pinhão fruit, a regional culinary staple. The Gralha Azul (Blue Jay) plays a vital ecological role in the cultivation of the Araucária, as it spreads its seeds throughout the region.</p>
